    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cookie recipe is of my favorites, because it is very simple and doesn't contain eggs or butter. You can either cut out the cookies with cookie cutters or a clean cup (depending on how fancy you want to be). These cookies will not spread very much, so you can put many cookies on a single baking sheet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 stick All-vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup seltzer water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of any milk alternative</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar</li>
            <li>Once creamed, pour in the egg, soy, and vanilla extract and wait till fully incorporated</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the flour, baking powder, and salt mixture</li>
            <li>Pour contents onto a sheet of parchment paper and put in refrigerator for 1 hour</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Take out the dough and roll it out on a counter top and cut out cookies using a bowl/cookie cutters</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown on the bottom edges, and once done immediately take off the baking sheet</li>
        </ol>
